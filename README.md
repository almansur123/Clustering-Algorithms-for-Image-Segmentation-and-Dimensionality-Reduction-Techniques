# Clustering-Algorithms-for-Image-Segmentation-and-Dimensionality-Reduction-Techniques

The project applies clustering and dimensionality reduction for image segmentation on a resized images (reduced to 50% size). The image data, originally in 3D RGB format, was converted to a 2D pixel matrix of size approximately 87,360 pixels Ã— 3 channels. PCA reduced this to 2 components, preserving over 95% variance for visualization. K-Means clustering with 5 clusters segmented the image but produced blurry boundaries. SLIC superpixel segmentation, using 200 segments and a compactness of 10, achieved clearer, more accurate boundaries. K-Means ran faster but was less precise, while SLIC delivered higher-quality segments. This study confirms that PCA effectively reduces dimensionality and that SLIC outperforms K-Means for detailed segmentation, with future work aimed at optimizing parameters and exploring other clustering techniques.
